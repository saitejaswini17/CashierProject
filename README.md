## üôã Why I Built This

I made this project while learning Python basics with the [PythonX](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rahul.pythonx) app. It helped me understand how to use functions, data structures, user input, and simple logic to solve everyday problems.  
If you‚Äôre learning Python too, I hope this project helps and inspires you!
